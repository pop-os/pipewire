Using pipewire for audio
========================

pipewire in Debian is primarily intended to be used for video
(screen sharing and remote desktop, particularly in GNOME and KDE Wayland
sessions). However, it can also be used for audio.

This is not a supported scenario for Debian 11, and is considered
experimental.

Using pipewire as a substitute for PulseAudio
---------------------------------------------

Install the pipewire-pulse package and log back in

Using pipewire as the default ALSA output device
------------------------------------------------

ALSA clients can be configured to output via pipewire instead of
PulseAudio or directly to ALSA.

To enable this:

* create an empty file /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/with-alsa

* copy /usr/share/doc/pipewire/examples/alsa.conf.d/99-pipewire-default.conf
  into /etc/alsa/conf.d/

Using pipewire as a substitute for JACK
---------------------------------------

JACK clients can be configured to output via pipewire instead of JACK.

To enable this:

* create an empty file /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/with-jack

* either run JACK clients using the pw-jack(1) wrapper, or copy
  /usr/share/doc/pipewire/examples/ld.so.conf.d/pipewire-jack-*.conf
  into /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ and run ldconfig as root.
