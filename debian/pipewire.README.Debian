Using pipewire for audio
========================

pipewire in Debian was initially used for video (screen sharing and remote
desktop, particularly in GNOME and KDE Wayland sessions). However, it has
matured enough to also be used for audio.


Using pipewire as a substitute for PulseAudio
---------------------------------------------

Install the pipewire-pulse package and log back in.
And potentially install the new recommended session manager
wireplumber instead of the deprecated pipewire-media-session.

PipeWire project recommends [1] to remove the pulseaudio package to prevent
conflicts in some cases [2] even if both pulseaudio and pipewire-pulse
services are not running at the same time.
pipewire-pulse doesn't conflict with pulseaudio at the package level to allow
users to switch from one to the other just by disabling/enabling services.

Using pipewire with Bluetooth
---------------------------------------------

Install the libspa-0.2-bluetooth package to add Bluetooth support to pipewire.

Pipewire (nor any other package) does not depend or recommend libspa-0.2-bluetooth
as not all users are interested in Bluetooth support.
The same apply to pulseaudio and pulseaudio-module-bluetooth:
pulseaudio does not depend or recommend pulseaudio-module-bluetooth.

However, pulseaudio-module-bluetooth and libspa-0.2-bluetooth are installed on
a system through the dependency of a Desktop Environment. For example,
with GNOME, the bluetooth plugin is pulled by the meta package gnome-core.

Moreover, both pipewire-pulse and wireplumber packages already suggest
to install the libspa-0.2-bluetooth package.


Using pipewire as the default ALSA output device
------------------------------------------------

Install the pipewire-alsa package.

ALSA clients will output via pipewire instead of PulseAudio or directly to
ALSA.

pipewire-alsa conflicts with pulseaudio because both try to take control of
all ALSA devices and redirect all audio streams to them. But, because of their
respective configs files name:
- PipeWire:	/etc/alsa/conf.d/99-pipewire-default.conf
- PulseAudio:	/etc/alsa/conf.d/99-pulse.conf
which make PulseAudio ordered after PipeWire. PulseAudio will take the
final control of ALSA clients even when pipewire-alsa is installed. Thus,
to allow ALSA clients redirecting output to pipewire, pulseaudio package
needs to be removed.

To check where streams are redirected, run the following command:
$ aplay -L | grep -A 1 default


Using pipewire as a substitute for JACK
---------------------------------------

Install the pipewire-jack package.

JACK clients can be configured to output via pipewire instead of JACK.

To enable this:

* create an empty file /etc/pipewire/media-session.d/with-jack

* either run JACK clients using the pw-jack(1) wrapper, or copy
  /usr/share/doc/pipewire/examples/ld.so.conf.d/pipewire-jack-*.conf
  into /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ and run ldconfig as root.


Setting pipewire real-time priority limits
---------------------------------------

!!!  WARNING  !!!
Your system has real-time priority limits for a good reason. This allows it
to remain stable in case a process goes crazy. RTKit allows limited use of
real-time priority without the risk of locking up the system if a real-time
task starts spinning.
Some upstream recommendations for real-time are to increase these limits to
bypass RTKit or to disable most of its safeguards. By following them, your
system could be blocked if a process goes wrong.
These performance tweaks are not needed for a normal use of pipewire, instead
modifying pipewire configuration is enough.
!!!  WARNING  !!!

The "pipewire" package creates a system group called "pipewire".
The upstream recommended priority limits for this group are defined in:

* /etc/security/limits.d/95-pipewire.conf

To enable these limits for your user, add it to the "pipewire" group.

* sudo adduser yourusername pipewire
