----------------------------
Use PipeWire instead of JACK
----------------------------

:Manual section: 1
:Manual group: General Commands Manual

SYNOPSIS
========

| **pw-jack** [*options*] *COMMAND* [*FILE*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

**pw-jack** modifies the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment
variable so that applications will load PipeWire's reimplementation
of the JACK client libraries instead of JACK's own
libraries. This results in JACK clients being redirected to
PipeWire.

If PipeWire's reimplementation of the JACK client libraries
has been installed as a system-wide replacement for JACK's
own libraries, then the whole system already behaves in that way,
in which case **pw-jack** has no practical effect.

OPTIONS
=======

-h
  Show help.

-r NAME
  The name of the remote instance to connect to. If left
  unspecified, a connection is made to the default PipeWire
  instance.

-v
  Verbose operation.

EXAMPLES
========

| **pw-jack** sndfile-jackplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/bell.oga

NOTES
=====

Using PipeWire for audio is currently considered to be
experimental.
