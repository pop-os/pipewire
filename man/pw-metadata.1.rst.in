SYNOPSIS
========

| **pw-metadata** [*options*] [*id* [*key* [*value* [*type* ] ] ] ]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Monitor, set and delete metadata on PipeWire objects.

Metadata are key/type/value triplets attached to objects identified
by *id*. The metadata is shared between all applications
binding to the same metadata object. When an object is destroyed, all its
metadata is automatically removed.

When no *value* is given, **pw-metadata** will query and
log the metadata matching the optional arguments *id*
and *key*. Without any arguments, all metadata is displayed.

When *value* is given, **pw-metadata** will set the
metadata for *id* and *key* to *value* and
an optional *type*.
