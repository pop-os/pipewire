; Texas Instruments PCM2902
;
; This is a generic chip used in multiple products, including at least
; Behringer U-Phoria UMC22, Behringer Xenyx 302USB, Intopic Jazz-UB700 and
; some unbranded "usb mini microphone".
;
; Behringer UMC22 has stereo input (representing two physical mono inputs),
; others have mono input.
;
; Some devices have a mic input path, but at least Behringer Xenyx 302USB
; doesn't have any input mixer controls.
;
; Since the UMC22 card has only stereo input PCM device but is commonly used
; with mono mics, we define special mono mappings using "mono,aux1" and
; "aux1,mono" channel maps. If we had only had the standard stereo input
; mapping, the user would have to record stereo tracks with one channel silent,
; which would be inconvenient.
;
; This config also removes default digital input/output mappings that do
; not physically exist on cards that we've seen so far.
