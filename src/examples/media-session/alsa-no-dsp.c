/** \page page_media_session_module_no_dsp Media Session Module: No DSP
 *
 * Instruct \ref page_media_session_module_policy_node to not configure audio
 * adapter nodes in DSP mode.  Device nodes will always be configured in
 * passthrough mode. If a client node wants to be linked with a device node
 * that has a different format, then the policy will configure the client node
 * in convert mode so that both nodes have the same format.
 *
 * This is done by just setting a session property flag, and policy-node does the rest.
