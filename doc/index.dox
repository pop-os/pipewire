/** \mainpage PipeWire

PipeWire is low-level multimedia framework that provides:
  - Graph based processing
  - Support for out-of-process processing graphs with minimal overhead
  - Flexible and extensible media format negotiation and buffer allocation
  - Hard real-time capable plugins
  - Very low-latency for both audio and video processing

See \ref page_overview for an overview of PipeWire and \ref page_design
for the design principles guiding PipeWire.

### Components

PipeWire ships with the following components:

- a \ref page_daemon that implements the IPC and graph processing
- an example \ref page_session_manager that manages objects in the \ref page_daemon
- a set of \ref page_tools to introspect and use the \ref page_daemon
- a \ref page_library to develop PipeWire applications and plugins (\ref
  page_tutorial "tutorial").
- the \ref page_spa used by both the \ref page_daemon and in the \ref
  page_library.
